> Note from (1/18/24): Thank you for using my very first project for your schedule ðŸ¤©, but unfortunately, there  won't be any maintenance or update for future class schedules ðŸ¥º. But, I would like to promote an alternative and better site [NTUMods ðŸ“…](https://ntumods.org) (I am one of the developers ðŸ˜Š) that has more features including the one I made on this site.

# NTU Schedule Calendar Generator

I remembered the days where I have to suffer by manually inputting the course schedule into my calendar app. To save up few hours of my life (and yours), I created this repository. This website in this repository allows the user to export their course schedule into an iCalendar file (which can be imported into most calendar applications).

- Frontend: [React](https://reactjs.org/), [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/)
- Backend: [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [BeautifulSoup 4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) (Webscrapping)
- iCalendar Generator: [ics](https://github.com/adamgibbons/ics)

## How to use it

There are two ways to input your course schedule, as well as the ability to modify it.

### Manual Input

You can manually type the course and index into the inputs of the first table.

Simply enter the course code or the course name into the first input and the suggestions will appear from the collected data.

Your desired module does not appear? You can add your own customized module by inserting manually as well (if you are a masochist),

or you can import from your Course Timetable by copying the row(s) of the subject you wanted to import

### Quick Input

### Text formatting

Dislike the default format of the calendar title? You can create your own with the available variables (listed on the website).
